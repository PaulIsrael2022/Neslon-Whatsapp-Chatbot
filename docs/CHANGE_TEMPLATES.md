## Using These Templates

1. **Choose the appropriate template** based on the type of change needed.
2. **Fill out all sections** completely to ensure nothing is missed.
3. **Review both frontend and backend sections** carefully before implementation.
4. **Track progress** using the checkboxes.
5. **Validate changes** using the provided testing requirements.

## Best Practices

1. **Always consider both sides**: Any change that affects data or business logic likely needs both frontend and backend changes.
2. **Test integration points**: Ensure frontend and backend changes work together seamlessly.
3. **Document dependencies**: Note any dependencies between frontend and backend changes.
4. **Plan deployment**: Consider whether changes need to be deployed in a specific order.
5. **Version control**: Use feature branches that include both frontend and backend changes.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: Making changes on one side without considering the other.
2. **Mismatched Data**: Frontend expecting data in a format the backend doesn't provide.
3. **Missing Validation**: Implementing validation on one side but not the other.
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error handling approaches between frontend and backend.
5. **Deployment Timing**: Deploying frontend and backend changes at different times causing incompatibilities.
